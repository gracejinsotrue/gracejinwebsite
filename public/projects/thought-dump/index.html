        <p><span class="date">7/2/2025:</span> I gave this some thought, but I think Tate McCrae's song lyric "she's got
            everything that i don't have" is an Escher sentence comparable to "more people have been to berlin than i
            have."

        <p><span class="date">7/2/2025: </span> My best friend whom I love and adore and very much and want to be like
            the most
            in this world has started his full time job at n*v*d*a this week, and it is tearing me to pieces inside. I
            am very proud of him, he is someone I have greatly admired. Yet, as I am human, I also envy. How does one
            continue living with love while also feeling intense envy? How strange it is to be anything at all.</p>

        <p><span class="date">7/2/2025: </span>My Github has been a green streak for almost a month, and it feels nice.
            It looks very cool. I thought going
            to Cornell was a great thing to accomplish, yet now I am dissatisfied with myself on all aspects. I think I
            have trouble of tying my self-worth to dynamically-changing materialistic standards expecting everything I
            don't have, how will I ever feel fulfilled?</p>
