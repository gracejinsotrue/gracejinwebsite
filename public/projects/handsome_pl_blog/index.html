            <p> Today, I wanted to replace the prototype home screen with one I've drawn. I tryharded too hard for
                this
                one lol, especially given that I have yet to finalize character designs, the art style, also this
                illustration
                style is too messy especially for a home screen, Peethon (Python) is too monochromatic. Actually,
                yeah,
                just because these guys are supposed to be personifications of their respective languages and
                subsequently their logos, it makes sense that they don their logo colors. But, it's fine if I
                deviate
                from solely their logo colors as well, looks better too!! But, I do like
                the character poses and
                placements as they're more dynamic than the previous version! I'll think about this some more.

                Kevin
                Nguyen of all time for pointing out the constraints for web: unique user sessions. I'm not familiar
                with
                serving backend and
                unique user session storage for web-based games, if that's even possible. See, I wasn't actualy sure
                if
                the final product would be web-based, but for the user experience it would be so quicker than a
                local
                download. I also just recently finished designing and programming <a
                    href="https://gdiac.cs.cornell.edu/gdiac/showcase/gallery/zoodini/" style="color: #af6bb1">a
                    desktop

                    style="color: #af6bb1">CS3152</a>,so it would be cool to do web-based
                this time. I
                did some research with google and with
                Claude (thanks again Anthropic for the $1 Claude premium.) Should be possible. I will take a look.

                principles and then I pair it
                with CSS and everything is misaligned. Hopefully it is not egregiously bad.

        <div class="entry-content">
            <p> I asked my $1 Claude (thanks Anthropic for giving a student discount to Cornell students haha...) to
                help me do the UI and console logic quickly for the
                <a href="prototype/prototype.html" style="color: #af6bb1">Web Prototype!</a>
            </p>
            <p> I referenced some dating sim UI's, such as <a
                    href="https://pm1.aminoapps.com/7441/579bc74f405bc6834fec7c8d345064b09d99a3bfr1-2048-996v2_hq.jpg"
                    style="color: #af6bb1" ;>Obey Me!</a>. Most visual novels have simplistic layouts, with the text
                box
                being the element that takes up the most space, and some variation of a noticeable but small back,
                forward, settings and menu button.
            </p>
            <p> A unique feature for my game would be allowing users to input code, and if they get it right, we've
                successfully rizzed
                the love interest more and they will like you slightly more each time. For prototyping, I might
                provide
                super simple problems (i.e. ask them how to access a character in a string) just let
                users
                type simple things and match it
                against a set of correct answers or something (very non-exhaustive checking but I don't yet have
                testers
                here solely to break my shit and find edge cases), and if they answer right, our character's
                affinity
                for our player goes up (I realize it should be indicated somewhere, unless I want to keep it a
                mystery in the backend.) I may include a set of hints, and an option to skip, but obviously with a
                warning that skipping is not a good idea! Your cute crush will not be happy with you!</p>

        <div class="entry-content">
            <p> !!Shoutout to Ellen Jo and Angela Qian for reading my shit while I was upating it today!
            </p>

            <p>I have been drawing personified programming languages for while online, with some of the posts
                reaching
                half a million views and 100k+ likes. This is some indicator that people liked what I put out there,
                and
                as I have been searching for a side project to do for fun, I thought to make a game where you can
                date
                programming languages. This idea was also inspired by the recent launch of
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/" style="color: #af6bb1" ;>Date
                    Everything</a> and <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/sogood_dev/" style="color: #af6bb1" ;>
                    sogood_dev's Instagram art. </a>
            </p>

            <p> I've drawn some initial sketches already. I think the premise of the storyline is going to be: "you
                are
                an intern at XYZ company (pays even better than Am*zon!) and you want to do your best to get a
                return
                offer. rizz up the personified
                programming languages and solve their questions (basic syntax questions, genral knowledge and coding
                problems) to win their hearts." And then you have various routes to choose, i.e. if you keep
                choosing
                interactions with Java and interacting with him, you will slowly rizz his heart.

                    ability
                    would frown upon other languages and call them garbage. I think I'll make Java the janitor at

                    to
                    lay out
                    for back, next, menu
                    buttons, etc. with minimal backend functionality -- I'll work on handling unique user login
                    sessions/password resets and all that .</li>
                <li>Research various otome game UI layouts. Obey Me! is going to see me log in after 100 days again,
                    lol.
                </li>
                <li>Write the script in my free time haha... I should probably also use Google Doc's Document Tabs
                    feature to be organized, because I see this script hard to manage when scaling up
