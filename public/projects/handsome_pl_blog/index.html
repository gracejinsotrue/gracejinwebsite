                even touched code at the time of writing this. Also, I am not good at neithr
                HTML nor CSS at all haha! You might be able to tell. I learn by doing and don't know all the HTML
                principles and then I pair it
                with CSS and everything is misaligned. Hopefully it is not egregiously bad.

        <div class="entry-content">
            <p> I asked my $1 Claude (thanks Anthropic for giving a student discount to Cornell students haha...) to
                help me do the UI and console logic quickly for the
                <a href="prototype/prototype.html" style="color: #af6bb1">Web Prototype!</a>
            </p>
            <p> I referenced some dating sim UI's, such as <a
                    href="https://pm1.aminoapps.com/7441/579bc74f405bc6834fec7c8d345064b09d99a3bfr1-2048-996v2_hq.jpg"
                    style="color: #af6bb1" ;>Obey Me!</a>. Most visual novels have simplistic layouts, with the text box
                being the element that takes up the most space, and some variation of a noticeable but small back,
                forward, settings and menu button.


            </p>
            <p> A unique feature for my game would be allowing users to input code, and if they get it right, we've
                successfully rizzed
                the love interest more and they will like you slightly more each time. For prototyping, I might provide
                super simple problems (i.e. ask them how to access a character in a string) just let
                users
                type simple things and match it
                against a set of correct answers or something (very non-exhaustive checking but I don't yet have testers
                here solely to break my shit and find edge cases), and if they answer right, our character's affinity
                for our player goes up (I realize it should be indicated somewhere, unless I want to keep it a
                mystery in the backend.) I may include a set of hints, and an option to skip, but obviously with a
                warning that skipping is not a good idea! Your cute crush will not be happy with you!</p>

        <h3 class="entry-title">Project Started!</h3>
        <div class="entry-content">
            <p> !!Shoutout to Ellen Jo and Angela Qian for reading my shit while I was upating it today!
            </p>

            <p>I have been drawing personified programming languages for while online, with some of the posts reaching
                half a million views and 100k+ likes. This is some indicator that people liked what I put out there, and
                as I have been searching for a side project to do for fun, I thought to make a game where you can date
                programming languages. This idea was also inspired by the recent launch of
                <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2201320/Date_Everything/" style="color: #af6bb1" ;>Date
                    Everything</a> and <a href=" https://www.instagram.com/sogood_dev/" style="color: #af6bb1" ;>
                    sogood_dev's Instagram art. </a>
            </p>

            <p> I've drawn some initial sketches already. I think the premise of the storyline is going to be: "you are
                an intern at XYZ company (pays even better than Am*zon!) and you want to do your best to get a return
                offer. rizz up the personified
                programming languages and solve their questions (basic syntax questions, genral knowledge and coding
                problems) to win their hearts." And then you have various routes to choose, i.e. if you keep choosing
                interactions with Java and interacting with him, you will slowly rizz his heart.
            </p>

                    buttons, etc. with minimal backend functionality -- I'll work on handling unique user login
                    sessions/password resets and all that .</li>
                <li>Research various otome game UI layouts. Obey Me! is going to see me log in after 100 days again,
                    lol.
                </li>
                <li>Write the script in my free time haha... I should probably also use Google Doc's Document Tabs
                    feature to be organized, because I see this script hard to manage when scaling up
